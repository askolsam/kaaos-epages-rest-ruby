basic_info = shop.info
german_info = shop.info(locale: 'de_DE')
```

## [Currencies](https://developer.epages.com/apps/api-reference/get-shops-shopid-currencies.html)

Retrieve the currency information of a shop. Returns a Hash with the keys:
 * default: The default currency of the shop

```

## [Locales](https://developer.epages.com/apps/api-reference/get-shops-shopid-locales.html)

## Parallel calls

Run the calls in different threads and return the responses in the same order as it was called. 
The keys must be the same that the name of the method to call. If you want to call multiple times tha same call with different parameters put every collection as an array element

```
requests = {
    products: {},
    categories: {locale: 'en_GB'},
    create_cart: {currency: 'USD', locale: 'en_US'},
}
product_requests = {
    products: [{sort: 'name', results_per_page: 2}, {results_per_page: 1, page: 3}],
}

response = shop.parallel_calls(requests)          # => { products: products_response, categories: categories_response, create_cart: create_cart_response }
product_response = shop.parallel_calls(requests)  # => { products: [products_response_1, products_response_2] }
```
